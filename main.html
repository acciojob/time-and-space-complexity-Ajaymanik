	<!<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires during its execution. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to represent how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
