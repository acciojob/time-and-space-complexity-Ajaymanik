	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient. (include 'efficient' somewhere in this paragraph)</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires during its execution. (include 'O(n)' somewhere in this paragraph)</p>
